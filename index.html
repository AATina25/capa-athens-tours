                <h3><a href="https://www.alternativeathens.com/tours/delphi-day-trip/">The Ultimate Delphi Day Trip (12 hours)</a></h3>
                <p>A full-day adventure to explore Delphi, the so-called center of the ancient world, and at the same time explore beautiful nearby villages and meet intriguing local people. We will visit the magnificent ancient site of Delphi and the beautiful museum, but unlike all other Delphi tours, this tour will let you discover rural Greece too: we’ll tour an eerie village lost in time and we’ll get to know one of the last tanners at work! Our delicious lunch will be in a local tavern, where the women of the village cook for us.</p>

                <p>A full-day exploration of the ancient city of Mycenae, with its legendary Lion Gate and the Tomb of Agamemnon. We’ll pair this site with a well-worth visit of the charming seaside port of Nafplio, the first capital of Greece, and get to see modern Greek artisans, including potters, where they will work their crafts in the traditional fashion, explaining as they create. By all means, we’ll also get a great break for lunch at one of Nafplio’s trendiest tavernas only locals know about!</p>

                <h3><a href="https://www.alternativeathens.com/tours/hydra-island-day-trip/">A Dazzling Day Trip to Hydra (11 hours)</a></h3>
                <p>This is a unique tour in the most picturesque island of Greece, the retreat of international jetsetters and rock stars (including Maria Callas, Leonard Cohen, Picasso, the Rolling Stones, and many more)! As soon as you arrive at the port you will understand why this car-free island was among the first Greek islands to become internationally famous. Then it’s time for a ride with the traditional means of transportation, the horse! The ride will be followed by a trip with a water taxi that will get you to an organized beach, where you will enjoy the sea and your lunch. Upon return to the port of Hydra, you will stroll its narrow streets and visit a well-preserved residence/museum of Greek Independence, as well as the residence and workshop of one of the many artists that found a peaceful refuge in Hydra. Finally, we will visit a local traditional pastry shop and see how the famous Hydra almond-based pastry is made!</p>

The tour covers it all, from the mesmerizing Ancient Temple of Aphaia to the island’s medieval capital, Paleochora, a beautiful modern sculpture museum with breathtaking views, tastings of the famous Aegina pistachio-based products, and a swim at one of Aegina’s prettiest beaches. One of the highlights of the trip is a visit to a local farm, where you'll see a cheese-monger at work, you'll make your own rice pudding, and try home-made cheeses along with tsipouro drink!</p>
